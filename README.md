# Nuxt_JS_WeatherAPP
## This app is a solution of a task.
## It uses two different apis at the same time so it can display the weather of the city for today and the upcoming 5 days.
### The original api gives array gives me 40 objects (one for each three hours - 24 / 3(hours) * 5(days) = 40 ) but I have reduced it to just 5 bu selecting every 8th element (1 for each day)
### Only the original icons are being used and as units I used metric units 
### I have used components (to display in the page), pages(about page does nothing I just put it there to show how the routing works ) and layouts(to be able to display the navbar)
### modern ES& features like destructuring have been heavily used
### Tailwind ocassionally has been used but also plain css to show my css skills
### Night and day mode has been added
### materialize icons have been used
### Pinia has been used for global state management
###Â I added a watch flag to the store changes and forced a rerender since It couldn't be achieved automatically

## Problems
#### More handling and animations could have been added
